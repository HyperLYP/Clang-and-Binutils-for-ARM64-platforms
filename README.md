# Clang-and-Binutils-for-ARM64-platforms

arm64设备上可用的clang和binutils

Maybe you want to try to compile the kernel on a mobile phone or other arm64 devices, then this compiler will be a good choice.

Before using this, maybe a simple cherry-pick of commit https://github.com/HyperLYP/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250/commit/74cba13b87d608675cf2c3bc0d5f2b6e94f234f8 is needed.
